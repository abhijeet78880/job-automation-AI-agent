<h1 align="center">Enable AI to control your browser ü§ñ</h1>




üåê Browser-use is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser. 

üí° See what others are building and share your projects in our [Discord](https://link.browser-use.com/discord) - we'd love to see what you create!



# Quick start


With pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

install playwright:

```bash
playwright install
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Go to Reddit, search for 'browser-use', click on the first post and return the first comment.",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```


### Test

simply run the gradio example:

```
uv pip install gradio
```

```bash
python examples/ui/gradio_demo.py
```

# Vision

Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.

## Roadmap

### Agent
- [ ] Improve agent memory (summarize, compress, RAG, etc.)
- [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
- [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction
- [ ] Improve extraction for datepickers, dropdowns, special elements
- [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements

### Rerunning tasks
- [ ] LLM as fallback
- [ ] Make it easy to define workfows templates where LLM fills in the details
- [ ] Return playwright script from the agent

### Datasets
- [ ] Create datasets for complex tasks
- [ ] Benchmark various models against each other
- [ ] Fine-tuning models for specific tasks

### User Experience
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop execution
- [ ] Improve the generated GIF quality
- [ ] Create various demos for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc.
